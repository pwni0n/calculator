This is my attempt at the final project from the Foundations course in The Odin Project.
This project will be a great test of all my programming abilities so far. I'm nervous, but I believe I can get through this, no matter how long it takes.

With this project, I am demonstrating these skills:
- Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional front-end product
- Covering all use cases to ensure my code is bug-free
- Staying committed to a project, even through frustration
- Breaking a big problem down into sub-problems and solving them all
